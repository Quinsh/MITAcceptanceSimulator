                Dear Gunwoo,
                <div class="gap25"></div>
                
                On behalf of the Admissions Committee, it is my pleasure to offer you admission to the MIT Class of 2023! You stood out as one of the most talented and promising students in one of the most competitive applicant pools in the history of the Institute. Your commitment to personal excellence and principled goals has convinced us you will both contribute to our diverse community and thrive within our academic environment. We think that you and MIT are a great match.
                <br><br>
                You have until May 1 to let us know if you'll call MIT your home for the next four years. Until then, we look forward to building a relationship with you and helping you get to know us better. We are pleased to invite you to join us in Cambridge for Campus Preview Weekend (CPW), April 11-14. CPW is one of the most fun and informative ways to discover all that MIT has to offer. Over the next several weeks, we'll be in touch with more details.
                <br><br>
                MIT's mission is to educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship, to best prepare them to solve the world's greatest challenges. Make no mistake, the rigor here is real, but so is the excitement of discovery in the classroom. The ways that students collaborate and help each other are varied and many.
                <br><br>
                I hope you'll agree with us that MIT is the perfect place to prepare for your future. As a member of our community, you'll join builders, scholars, entrepreneurs, and humanitarians. Together, you will make a true difference in a world that desperately needs you.
                <br><br>
                Many congratulations and welcome to MIT! Now stop reading this and go celebrate!
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                <br>
